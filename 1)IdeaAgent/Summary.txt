== 1)IdeaGenerationAgent(Self Effort).ipynb
In this file, two approaches are used to fetch titles from YouTube
1) It displays trending youTube Video Titles only for a specific region
2) It displays trending youTube Video Titles, based on both specific region and category

= Note: We can get idea of regions and categories from 'region.jpeg'(PK for Pakistan, IN for India) and 'category_id.jpeg'(10 for Music, 17 for SPorts).

= Enhancements:
- Its difficult to memorize category_id, the best way is to use category_name.
- Take both(region and category_name) from user.


== 2) Guide-Idea-Agent.docx
A complete guide to take category from user, and fetch video titles

= Enhancements:
- Video Titles should only be in English
- Titles should not contain any hashtags.
- It only asks user for category_name, however we can also ask region from user.


== 3) idea_agent.ipynb
In this file, first the user is asked to enter the region, and then enter the category. Video titles are displayed based on the user's entered region and category.

= Limitations:
- Categories are hard coded. Its possible that user may want any other of these categories.
- Its also possible that category supported for a region, may not be supported in other region.


== 4) idea_agent.py
Code in OOP design.
Displays youTube video titles based on a specific category entered by user. The titles are in English, and contains no hashtags. 
It works fine among all approache used until now.

= Enhancements:
- The user should also be given the option of selecting the region

== 5) gui(idea_agent.py)
A GUI(using Tkinter) based approach to fetch YouTube video Titles for a selected region and category.

= Limitations:
- Titles contains hashtags, and titles are also in other languages.
- May be a particular category not be supported in some region (i.e. 'Region=IN', 'Category=Short Movies' gives no titles, while 'Region=IN', 'Category=Comedy' provides titles)
